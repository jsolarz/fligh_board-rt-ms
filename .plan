---

## Progress Log

### **Step 1: Project Structure Setup** ✅ DONE
*The foundation matters. Get the scaffolding right or everything built on top will be wobbly.*

**What actually happened:**
- Created .NET 9 solution with Web API project ✅
- Generated two React TypeScript frontends (Consumer + Backoffice) ✅  
- Updated project to target .NET 9.0 framework ✅
- Solution builds clean (`dotnet build`) ✅
- README with setup instructions ✅
- Git repo initialized with proper .gitignore ✅

**Commit:** `feat: initial project structure setup`

**Reality check:** Smooth sailing. No surprises. The tooling for .NET 9 and React is mature.

---

### **Step 2: Database Foundation** ✅ DONE  
*Entity Framework is like a Swiss Army knife - powerful but you need to know which blade to use for which job.*

**What actually happened:**
- EF Core packages installed (SQLite, Design, Tools) ✅
- `BaseEntity` with audit fields (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted, CreatedBy, UpdatedBy) ✅
- `Flight` entity with comprehensive properties and enums ✅
- `FlightDbContext` with proper indexes, soft deletes, audit handling ✅
- Initial migration `InitialFlightSchema` created and applied ✅
- `DatabaseSeeder` with realistic sample data (60 flights) ✅
- **SECURITY IMPROVEMENT:** Moved database to `Data/` folder outside project directory ✅
- **MODERNIZATION:** Converted DTOs to .NET 9 records with `required`/`init` properties ✅

**Technical notes:**
- Soft delete implemented via global query filters
- Automatic audit timestamp updates in `SaveChanges()`
- Comprehensive indexes for performance (single + composite)
- Pure C# mapping service (no AutoMapper bloat)

**Commit:** `feat: complete Step 2 - Database Foundation with modern .NET 9 features`

**Reality check:** The record DTO conversion was the right call. Immutable by default, less boilerplate, and the `required` keyword catches missing properties at compile time. Moving the database was smart - no secrets in the project folder.

---

### **Step 3: Basic API Endpoints** ✅ DONE
*APIs are contracts. Make them clear, predictable, and hard to misuse.*

**What actually happened:**
- `FlightsController` with full CRUD operations ✅
- Modern record DTOs with comprehensive validation attributes ✅
- `FlightService` with business logic separation ✅
- Pure C# mapping service (no external dependencies) ✅
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes ✅
- CORS configured for frontend apps ✅

**API Endpoints implemented:**
```
GET    /api/flights              (paginated, searchable)
GET    /api/flights/{id}         (single flight)
POST   /api/flights              (create)
PUT    /api/flights/{id}         (update)
DELETE /api/flights/{id}         (soft delete)
GET    /api/flights/departures   (paginated departures)
GET    /api/flights/arrivals     (paginated arrivals)  
GET    /api/flights/active       (current active flights)
GET    /api/flights/delayed      (delayed flights)
PATCH  /api/flights/{id}/status  (status updates)
```

**Live test results:**
- API responding on localhost:5183 ✅
- Paginated responses working (tested with `?pageSize=3`) ✅  
- Sample data loaded (60 total flights confirmed) ✅
- Departures/arrivals endpoints functional ✅

**Technical debt:** None identified. Clean separation of concerns.

**Next commit:** Will be Step 3 completion

**Reality check:** This is where the modern C# features really shine. Records make the DTOs bulletproof, and the validation attributes catch bad data at the boundary. The API is fast and responsive even with the comprehensive indexing.

---

### **Step 4: Frontend Foundation (Consumer App)** ✅ DONE
*React is like a Swiss Army knife for UIs - powerful when you use the right blade for each job.*

**What actually happened:**
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query) + Axios installed ✅
- TypeScript interfaces created matching backend DTOs ✅
- FlightApiService with comprehensive error handling ✅
- FlightBoard component with responsive table design ✅

- **FlightAdded** - Group-specific flight additions

**SignalR Groups for Filtering:**
- **AllFlights** - All flight updates
- **Departures** - Departure-specific updates
- **Arrivals** - Arrival-specific updates

**Frontend Features:**
- Automatic connection with retry logic [0, 2000, 10000, 30000]ms
- React Query cache invalidation on real-time events
- Connection status indicator in UI
- Cyberpunk-styled real-time notifications
- Group-based subscription filtering

**Technical Implementation:**
- Hub context injection into FlightService
- SignalR notifications on Create/Update/StatusChange operations
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- TypeScript interfaces for SignalR events
- Error handling for connection failures

**Commit:** `feat: complete Step 5 - SignalR real-time updates with cyberpunk UI integration`

**Reality check:** SignalR integration was smoother than expected. The modern @microsoft/signalr client handles reconnection gracefully, and the React Query integration ensures the UI stays synchronized. The cyberpunk notification styling adds to the immersive experience.

---
- SignalR connection management (reconnection logic)
- State synchronization between polling and real-time updates
- Performance with many concurrent connections

**Architecture decision pending:** Whether to use SignalR for all updates or hybrid approach (polling + SignalR for critical updates).

---

### **Step 6: Flight Management (Backoffice App)** ✅ COMPLETED
*Old school BBS terminal aesthetic meets modern flight management capabilities.*

**What actually happened:**
- **BBS Terminal Styling** implemented with authentic old-school terminal aesthetics ✅

**Commit:** `feat: complete Step 6 - Flight Management Backoffice App with BBS terminal styling`

**Reality check:** The BBS terminal aesthetic works brilliantly for an admin interface. The green-on-black color scheme, monospace fonts, and terminal prompts create an authentic retro computing experience while maintaining modern usability. The contrast with the cyberpunk consumer app creates distinct visual identities for different user roles.
- **BBS Terminal Styling** - Old school bulletin board system aesthetic
- **Administrative focus** - Form-heavy interface for data management
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete flights
- **Real-time integration** - Changes broadcast via SignalR to Consumer app

**Architecture Plan:**
```
Backoffice App Structure:
src/
├── components/
│   ├── FlightForm.tsx       (main form for CRUD operations)
│   ├── FlightList.tsx       (admin flight list with actions)
│   ├── DeleteConfirm.tsx    (confirmation dialog)
│   ├── BBSHeader.tsx        (terminal-style header)
│   └── ErrorAlert.tsx       (error handling component)
├── services/
│   └── flight-admin.service.ts (admin API calls)
├── types/
│   └── admin.types.ts       (admin-specific interfaces)
└── App.tsx                  (main BBS-styled app)
```

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing backend API endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE /api/flights)
- Integrate with SignalR for real-time updates to consumer app
- Form validation using React Hook Form or similar
- BBS terminal styling with monospace fonts, green text, dark background
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

**Progress Tracking:**
- Planning phase: COMPLETE ✅
- Implementation phase: READY TO START ⏳

**Next Actions:**
1. Read specification files ✅ 
2. Document requirements in .plan ✅
3. Setup backoffice app styling and structure
4. Implement FlightForm component
5. Add validation and error handling
6. Test integration with existing API
7. Verify real-time updates work

**Reality check:** The backoffice needs to feel like an old-school system administrator terminal while providing modern functionality. This contrast should be interesting to implement.
