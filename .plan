## Progress Log

### **Step 1: Project Structure Setup** ✅ DONE
*The foundation matters. Get the scaffolding right or everything built on top will be wobbly.*

**What actually happened:**
- Created .NET 9 solution with Web API project ✅
- Generated two React TypeScript frontends (Consumer + Backoffice) ✅  
- Updated project to target .NET 9.0 framework ✅
- Solution builds clean (`dotnet build`) ✅
- README with setup instructions ✅
- Git repo initialized with proper .gitignore ✅

**Commit:** `feat: initial project structure setup`

**Reality check:** Smooth sailing. No surprises. The tooling for .NET 9 and React is mature.

---

### **Step 2: Database Foundation** ✅ DONE  
*Entity Framework is like a Swiss Army knife - powerful but you need to know which blade to use for which job.*

**What actually happened:**
- EF Core packages installed (SQLite, Design, Tools) ✅
- `BaseEntity` with audit fields (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted, CreatedBy, UpdatedBy) ✅
- `Flight` entity with comprehensive properties and enums ✅
- `FlightDbContext` with proper indexes, soft deletes, audit handling ✅
- Initial migration `InitialFlightSchema` created and applied ✅
- `DatabaseSeeder` with realistic sample data (60 flights) ✅
- **SECURITY IMPROVEMENT:** Moved database to `Data/` folder outside project directory ✅
- **MODERNIZATION:** Converted DTOs to .NET 9 records with `required`/`init` properties ✅

**Technical notes:**
- Soft delete implemented via global query filters
- Automatic audit timestamp updates in `SaveChanges()`
- Comprehensive indexes for performance (single + composite)
- Pure C# mapping service (no AutoMapper bloat)

**Commit:** `feat: complete Step 2 - Database Foundation with modern .NET 9 features`

**Reality check:** The record DTO conversion was the right call. Immutable by default, less boilerplate, and the `required` keyword catches missing properties at compile time. Moving the database was smart - no secrets in the project folder.

---

### **Step 3: Basic API Endpoints** ✅ DONE
*APIs are contracts. Make them clear, predictable, and hard to misuse.*

**What actually happened:**
- `FlightsController` with full CRUD operations ✅
- Modern record DTOs with comprehensive validation attributes ✅
- `FlightService` with business logic separation ✅
- Pure C# mapping service (no external dependencies) ✅
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes ✅
- CORS configured for frontend apps ✅

**API Endpoints implemented:**
```
GET    /api/flights              (paginated, searchable)
GET    /api/flights/{id}         (single flight)
POST   /api/flights              (create)
PUT    /api/flights/{id}         (update)
DELETE /api/flights/{id}         (soft delete)
GET    /api/flights/departures   (paginated departures)
GET    /api/flights/arrivals     (paginated arrivals)  
GET    /api/flights/active       (current active flights)
GET    /api/flights/delayed      (delayed flights)
PATCH  /api/flights/{id}/status  (status updates)
```

**Live test results:**
- API responding on localhost:5183 ✅
- Paginated responses working (tested with `?pageSize=3`) ✅  
- Sample data loaded (60 total flights confirmed) ✅
- Departures/arrivals endpoints functional ✅

**Technical debt:** None identified. Clean separation of concerns.

**Next commit:** Will be Step 3 completion

**Reality check:** This is where the modern C# features really shine. Records make the DTOs bulletproof, and the validation attributes catch bad data at the boundary. The API is fast and responsive even with the comprehensive indexing.

---

### **Step 4: Frontend Foundation (Consumer App)** ✅ DONE
*React is like a Swiss Army knife for UIs - powerful when you use the right blade for each job.*

The contrast with the cyberpunk consumer app creates distinct visual identities for different user roles.
- **BBS Terminal Styling** - Old school bulletin board system aesthetic
- **Administrative focus** - Form-heavy interface for data management
- **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete flights
- **Real-time integration** - Changes broadcast via SignalR to Consumer app

**Architecture Plan:**
```
Backoffice App Structure:
src/
├── components/
│   ├── FlightForm.tsx       (main form for CRUD operations)
│   ├── FlightList.tsx       (admin flight list with actions)
│   ├── DeleteConfirm.tsx    (confirmation dialog)
│   ├── BBSHeader.tsx        (terminal-style header)
│   └── ErrorAlert.tsx       (error handling component)
├── services/
│   └── flight-admin.service.ts (admin API calls)
├── types/
│   └── admin.types.ts       (admin-specific interfaces)
└── App.tsx                  (main BBS-styled app)
```

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing backend API endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE /api/flights)
- Integrate with SignalR for real-time updates to consumer app
- Form validation using React Hook Form or similar
- BBS terminal styling with monospace fonts, green text, dark background
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

**Progress Tracking:**
- Planning phase: COMPLETE ✅

    var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
    var minutesUntilDeparture = (scheduledDeparture - now).TotalMinutes;
    
    return minutesUntilDeparture switch
    {
        > 30 => FlightStatus.Scheduled,        // More than 30 min before
        <= 30 and > 0 => FlightStatus.Boarding, // 30 min before to departure
        <= 0 and > -60 => FlightStatus.Departed, // 0 to 60 min after departure
        <= -60 => FlightStatus.Landed,         // More than 60 min after
        _ => FlightStatus.Scheduled
    };

*Last updated: July 21, 2025 - Step 7 Search and Filtering COMPLETED*

## CURRENT SESSION: STEP 7 COMPLETED ✅

**Session Goal:** Implement comprehensive search and filtering frontend functionality  
**STATUS:** COMPLETED ✅ - Advanced search interface with backend integration fully working  
**Next:** Ready to proceed with Step 8 (Redux Toolkit Integration) or Step 9 (Unit Testing Infrastructure)

### ✅ STEP 7: Search and Filtering - COMPLETED & TESTED
**What was implemented:**
- **SearchFilters Component:** Cyberpunk-styled collapsible search interface with 7 filter types
- **Pagination Component:** Professional pagination with intelligent page navigation and loading states  
- **Smart Query Logic:** Uses search endpoint only when filters are active, optimized for performance
- **Backend Integration:** Seamless integration with the `/api/flights/search` endpoint created in alignment tasks
- **TESTING VERIFIED:** ✅ Multiple search combinations tested and working
  - Combined filters: `?destination=LAX&status=Scheduled&pageSize=3` ✅
  - Partial matching: `?flightNumber=UA&pageSize=3` ✅  
  - Airline filtering: `?airline=AA&pageSize=5` ✅
- **Impact:** HIGH ✅ - Users can now efficiently search and filter flights with real-time results

### **Technical Achievements:**
- **7 Filter Types:** Flight number, destination, status, airline, origin, delayed flights, date ranges
- **Performance Optimized:** 500ms debounced input, useCallback optimization, smart endpoint selection
- **UX Excellence:** Collapsible interface, active filter indicators, clear all functionality, loading states
- **Styling Consistency:** Custom CSS classes maintain cyberpunk theme across all form elements
- **Mobile Responsive:** Grid layouts adapt to screen size, touch-friendly controls
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript integration with proper parameter typing

### **Code Quality:**
- **Component Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns, reusable components
- **State Management:** Local filter state with controlled parent synchronization
- **Error Handling:** Disabled states during loading, proper form validation
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive comments and JSDoc annotations

**Technical Changes Made:**
- **New Components:** SearchFilters.tsx, Pagination.tsx
- **Enhanced Components:** FlightBoard.tsx (smart query logic), index.ts (exports)
- **API Services:** Updated both consumer and backoffice with searchFlights endpoint
- **CSS Additions:** cyber-input, cyber-select, cyber-checkbox classes with holographic effects
- **Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully with no errors
- **API Status:** ✅ Search endpoints tested and responding correctly
- **Frontend Status:** ✅ Search interface fully functional and styled

**Ready for Next Steps:**
- Step 8: Redux Toolkit Integration (for advanced UI state management)
- Step 9: Unit Testing Infrastructure (xUnit + Moq for backend, Jest + Testing Library for frontend)
- Step 10: Clean Architecture Refactoring (Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers)
