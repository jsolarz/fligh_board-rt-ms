# Summary of Objectives

## Objective
Develop a professional, full-stack, real-time flight board management system using modern development practices and enterprise-grade architecture. The system will feature a live-updating flight board, a comprehensive backend API, robust security, high availability, and a clean, user-friendly UI that supports both administrative and consumer operations.

## Technologies
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (C#), Entity Framework Core with SQLite/SQL Server, SignalR, Redis Caching, xUnit/NUnit with Moq.
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query (React Query), CSS/Tailwind/styled-components/Material UI.
- **Infrastructure**: Azure App Service, Azure SignalR Service, Azure SQL Database, Azure Key Vault, Azure Monitor.
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps, Docker, automated testing, monitoring.

## Core Features
1. **Dual Application Architecture**:
   - **Backoffice Application**: Administrative interface for flight management with RBAC.
   - **Consumer Application**: Public interface for viewing and searching flights.
   - Role-based access control with multi-role support per user.

2. **Real-Time Flight Board**:
   - SignalR for live updates across all connected clients.
   - Automatic flight status calculation based on departure times.
   - Frontend table with columns: Flight Number, Destination, Departure Time, Gate, Status.

3. **Flight Management & Architecture**:
   - RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations and advanced search.
   - Clean Architecture principles with IDesign Method integration.
   - Persistent database with Entity Framework Core.
   - Comprehensive server-side validation and error handling.

4. **Enterprise-Grade Features**:
   - Performance requirements: 99.9% uptime, <200ms response times.
   - Multi-layer caching strategy (Redis, CDN, browser caching).
   - Automated backup and disaster recovery with 15-minute RTO.
   - Health monitoring and alerting with comprehensive metrics.

5. **Security & Compliance**:
   - JWT-based authentication with multi-factor authentication.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) with audit logging.
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit.
   - GDPR compliance with data retention policies.

6. **API Management**:
   - API versioning strategy with backward compatibility.
   - Rate limiting and throttling protection.
   - Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
   - Auto-generated client SDKs.

7. **Testing & Quality Assurance**:
   - Unit tests for critical backend logic with 80% coverage requirement.
   - Integration, end-to-end, and load testing.
   - Security testing with automated vulnerability scanning.
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing.

8. **Performance & Scalability**:
   - Support for 1,000+ concurrent users.
   - Database indexing and query optimization.
   - Load balancing and horizontal scaling capabilities.
   - CDN integration for static asset delivery.

### Updated Summary

#### Core Features
- Updated to include the use of **Queue/Bus Proxy** for decoupling the frontend from the backend.
- Highlighted the roles of **Manager**, **Engine**, and **Accessor** in the backend architecture.
- Clarified that all frontend interactions with the backend are routed through the **ManagerProxy**.

## Architecture Highlights
- **IDesign Method**: Manager, Engine, and Accessor pattern implementation.
- **Queue/Bus Proxy**: Decoupled frontend-backend communication.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns across Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and API layers.
- **Microservices-Ready**: Designed for future microservices decomposition.

## Operational Excellence
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configurations with feature flags.
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation and fault tolerance.
- **Third-party Integration Framework**: Extensible integration with external services.

## Bonus Features
- Frontend animations and optimistic updates.
- Backend structured logging and FluentValidation.
- Docker support for containerization.
- Mobile responsiveness with offline capabilities.
- Multi-language support preparation.
- Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities.

## Compliance & Standards
- **Data Retention**: 7-year retention for flight data, 1-year for audit logs.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Browser Support**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+.
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for tablets and mobile devices.

## Submission Guidelines
- Clean, modular code with documentation.
- Unit test project included.
- README with setup instructions, architectural choices, and third-party libraries.
