## Data Design

### Database Structure and Table Layouts
The database is designed to store flight information with the following schema:
- **Flights Table**:
  - `FlightID` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each flight.
  - `FlightNumber`: The flight number assigned by the airline.
  - `Destination`: The destination of the flight.
  - `DepartureTime`: Scheduled departure time.
  - `Gate`: Assigned gate for the flight.
  - `Status`: Current status of the flight (e.g., On Time, Delayed, Cancelled).

### User and Role Management in Data Design

To support role-based access control (RBAC) and manage user access:

#### Database Structure Updates
- **Users Table**:
  - `UserID` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
  - `Username`: The username for authentication.
  - `PasswordHash`: Hashed password for secure authentication.

- **Roles Table**:
  - `RoleID` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each role.
  - `RoleName`: Name of the role (e.g., Admin, Consumer).

- **UserRoles Table**:
  - `UserID` (Foreign Key): Links to the `Users` table.
  - `RoleID` (Foreign Key): Links to the `Roles` table.
  - **Purpose**: Allows a user to have multiple roles by creating a many-to-many relationship between users and roles.

#### Authorization Logic Updates
- Users can have multiple roles, and their permissions will be the union of all their roles.
- Admins can access both the Backoffice and Consumer Applications.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) will check all roles assigned to a user to determine access permissions.

#### Data Flow for Authentication and Authorization
1. **Authentication**:
   - Users log in via the Backoffice or Consumer Application.
   - The backend validates credentials against the `Users` table.

2. **Authorization**:
   - The backend checks the user's role to determine access permissions.
   - Admins can access both the Backoffice and Consumer Applications, while Consumers are restricted to read-only operations.

#### Data Validation and Integrity Rules
- **Validation Rules**:
  - `Username` must be unique and non-empty.
  - `PasswordHash` must meet security standards (e.g., bcrypt hashing).
  - `Role` must be one of the predefined values (Admin, Consumer).

- **Integrity Rules**:
  - Foreign key constraints to ensure valid role assignments.
  - Transactions to maintain atomicity during user creation or updates.

    ROLES ||--o{ USERROLES : "assigned to"
    FLIGHTS ||--o{ USERS : "managed by"
```

### Data Flow Diagrams
The data flow between components is as follows:
1. **Frontend**: Sends user actions (e.g., add, delete, search) to the backend via REST API.
2. **Backend**: Processes the request, validates data, and interacts with the database.
3. **Database**: Stores or retrieves flight data as requested by the backend.
4. **SignalR**: Broadcasts real-time updates to all connected clients.

```mermaid

    B -->|Query/Update| C[Database]
    B -->|Broadcast Updates| D[SignalR]
    D -->|Push Updates| A
```

### Data Validation and Integrity Rules
- **Validation Rules**:
  - `FlightNumber` must be unique and non-empty.
  - `DepartureTime` must be a valid future date and time.
  - `Gate` must be a valid alphanumeric string.
  - `Status` must be one of the predefined values (e.g., On Time, Delayed, Cancelled).
- **Integrity Rules**:
  - Foreign key constraints to ensure data consistency.
  - Transactions to maintain atomicity during updates.

### Data Storage and Retrieval
- **Storage**:
  - SQLite is used for local development and testing.
  - Tables are normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Retrieval**:
  - Optimized queries are used to fetch data based on search and filter criteria.
  - Indexes are created on frequently queried columns like `FlightNumber` and `DepartureTime`.

## Component Design

### Purpose and Responsibilities

#### Separation of Applications
To ensure a clear separation of concerns and enhance security, scalability, and maintainability, the system will be divided into two distinct applications:

1. **Backoffice Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Manage flight data, including adding, updating, and deleting flights.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Provide administrative interfaces for authorized personnel.
     - Validate and persist flight data to the database.
     - Ensure compliance with data integrity and validation rules.
     - Authenticate and authorize users with elevated privileges.

2. **Consumer Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Display real-time flight information to end-users.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Retrieve and display flight data from the backend.
     - Enable users to search and filter flights.
     - Provide real-time updates using SignalR.
     - Ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Access Control Considerations

To ensure proper access control and prevent unauthorized usage:

1. **Backoffice Application**:
   - Restricted to authorized personnel with administrative roles.
   - Access is managed through **role-based access control (RBAC)**.
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure only users with elevated privileges can log in.

2. **Consumer Application**:
   - Open to general users for viewing, searching, and filtering flights.
   - Does not allow administrative actions like adding, updating, or deleting flights.

3. **Separation of Access**:
   - Users with access to the Backoffice Application can also use the Consumer Application if their roles permit.
   - Consumers cannot access the Backoffice Application under any circumstances.

4. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
   - If both applications share the same user base, implement SSO to allow seamless transitions while maintaining security.

5. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - All access attempts and actions in the Backoffice Application are logged for audit purposes.
   - Logs are retained for a minimum of 90 days to comply with regulatory requirements.

### Interaction Between Applications
- The **Backoffice Application** will update the flight data in the database.
- The **Consumer Application** will retrieve the updated data and display it to users in real-time.
- Both applications will interact with the backend through well-defined APIs and the Queue/Bus Proxy for decoupled communication.

### Benefits of Separation
- **Security**: Restricts flight management to authorized personnel, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications.
- **Scalability**: Allows each application to scale independently based on its specific workload.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies development, testing, and deployment by isolating functionalities.
- **User Experience**: Focuses each application on its target audience, ensuring a tailored experience.

#### Interaction Rules
- **Frontend**:
  - Interacts with the backend only through the Queue/Bus Proxy.
- **Manager**:
  - Calls Engines and Accessors to fulfill use case requirements.
  - Queues calls to other Managers when needed, ensuring asynchronous communication.
- **Engine**:
  - Calls Accessors for data retrieval or updates.
- **Accessor**:
  - Directly interacts with the database or external services.

#### Dependencies
- **Frontend**:
  - React, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query, and a Queue/Bus library (e.g., RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus).
- **Backend**:
  - ASP.NET Core, SignalR, Entity Framework Core, and a Queue/Bus library.
- **Database**:
  - SQLite for local development.

---

## User Interface Design

### Wireframes or Mockups
The user interface (UI) is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring seamless interaction for users. Below are the key wireframes:
- **Flight Board Screen**: Displays a real-time list of flights with details such as flight number, destination, departure time, gate, and status. Includes search and filter options.
- **Add Flight Form**: A form for adding new flights, with fields for flight number, destination, departure time, gate, and status.
- **Search and Filter Panel**: Allows users to search for flights by destination, departure time, or status, and apply filters.

### User Workflows and Interactions
1. **Viewing Flights**:
   - Users access the flight board to view real-time updates.
   - Search and filter options are available for quick navigation.
2. **Adding a Flight**:
   - Users fill out the "Add Flight" form and submit it.
   - The system validates the input and updates the flight board in real-time.
3. **Deleting a Flight**:
   - Users select a flight and confirm deletion.
   - The system removes the flight and updates the board in real-time.

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard shortcuts.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Labels and ARIA attributes are added to ensure compatibility with screen readers.
- **Color Contrast**: The UI adheres to WCAG guidelines for color contrast to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.
