# CI/CD Pipelines

This directory will contain Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline configurations.

## Planned Pipelines

### GitHub Actions
- `.github/workflows/` directory with:
  - Build and test automation
  - Docker image building and pushing
  - Security scanning
  - Deployment to staging/production

### Azure DevOps
- `azure-pipelines.yml` for:
  - Multi-stage pipeline (Build, Test, Deploy)
  - Integration with Azure services
  - Release management
  - Environment approvals

### GitLab CI
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` for:
  - Container-based builds
  - Automated testing
  - Registry integration
  - Deployment automation

### Jenkins
- `Jenkinsfile` for:
  - Pipeline as code
  - Integration with various tools
  - Custom deployment scripts
  - Notification systems

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Build Stage
- Restore NuGet packages
- Build .NET API
- Build React frontends
- Run static code analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning

### 2. Test Stage
- Unit tests (.NET API)
- Integration tests
- Frontend tests (Jest, Cypress)
- Code coverage reporting
- Performance testing

### 3. Package Stage
- Build Docker images
- Push to container registry
- Create deployment artifacts
- Generate release notes

### 4. Deploy Stage
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests
- Deploy to production (with approval)
- Health checks and monitoring

## Integration Points

### Code Quality
- SonarQube integration
- ESLint for frontend
- .NET analyzers
- Code coverage thresholds

### Security
- OWASP dependency check
- Container image scanning
- Secrets management
- Security policy enforcement

### Monitoring
- Deployment notifications
- Health check monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

## Environment Management

### Development
- Automatic deployment on feature branch push
- Integration testing
- Code quality gates

### Staging
- Manual deployment approval
- End-to-end testing
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing

### Production
- Manual deployment approval
- Blue-green deployment
- Rollback capabilities
- Post-deployment monitoring

## Getting Started

Once CI/CD pipelines are added, they will automatically:

1. **On Pull Request**: Build, test, and validate changes
2. **On Merge to Main**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **On Release Tag**: Deploy to production with approval

Example GitHub Actions workflow trigger:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]
```
